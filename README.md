# About 
This web app is created for [NUS iCreate Challenge 2013](http://icreate.nus.edu.sg/).

# Objective:
Encourage Mutual Help, Information Sharing and Mutual-Communication

# Initiative:
We believe people in general are willing to help each other, and it’s possible to know more people through this helping process. Meanwhile, people in one field may need help in another.

There are people who need help found it very hard to gain help, because they don’t know whom to task.
There are people who have time and can actually offer help to other people, but they don’t know who need help.

Thus, we want to create such kind of platform for people to post help request on certain fields, and we believe the process of communication can be made fun, thus some interesting features are added to the system to facilitate interesting communication process.

# Set Up the Server:
Note: the setup for Server has been Verified on Mac and Ubuntu machine. Most likely RubyOnRails cannot work well on Windows Machine.
1. Install Ruby 2.0.0. Recommend to install from rvm
2. cd to our project's root folder, run `bundle install`. This would install all necessary Gem files.
3. install ImageMagick. On Mac, either via macport, or homebrew; on Ubuntu, via apt-get.
4. Run `rails s` to start our app on server
